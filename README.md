## üìã Overview
This project is a complete data science application built from scratch. It takes raw text data from the Amazon Product Reviews Dataset, processes it, and trains two different models: a deep learning model for sentiment analysis and a machine learning model for fake review detection. These models are then served through a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit, allowing for real-time analysis of any user-provided review.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies review sentiment as **POSITIVE** or **NEGATIVE** using a fine-tuned **DistilBERT** model from Hugging Face, powered by a **TensorFlow** backend.
- **Intelligent Fake Review Detection**: Uses an **XGBoost Classifier** to identify potentially biased or low-effort reviews based on lexical and text-based features.
- **Real-World Data**: Trained and evaluated on the **Amazon Product Reviews Dataset** for robust performance.
- **Interactive UI**: Clean, user-friendly web interface built with **Streamlit** for easy input and visualization.

## üöÄ Project Workflow
1. **Environment Setup**: Created `venv` for dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. **Data Processing**: Parsed, sampled, and cleaned Amazon Reviews dataset; engineered proxy "fake" label; saved as `processed_reviews.csv`.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Generated TF-IDF features, uppercase ratio, punctuation count, and other lexical metrics.
4. **Model Training**: Trained **XGBoost Classifier** on balanced dataset.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Tested on unseen data for accuracy, precision, and recall.
6. **Application Development**: Integrated models into **Streamlit** app for real-time inference.

---

## üß† Model Iteration and Improvement
- **Problem**: Initial small, imbalanced dataset led to overfitting.
- **Solution**: Built a **larger, balanced dataset** (40,000+ reviews).
- **Result**: Retrained model achieved much more robust performance, proving that data quality and quantity are critical.
